Raspberry Pi Ham Radio Repeater Software/Controller

Basically, this software project is to create a fully capable amateur radio repeater using a Raspberry Pi as the control device. Since the Pi has a large number of GPIOs and built in audio interfaces (with expansion available for audio via USB devices), it seems a convenient way to advance the repeater's abilities without having to work with pure hardware controllers.
